    <description><![CDATA[introduce methods of interpretation that will be used throughout the rest of the book. Models for categorical outcomes are nonlinear, and this nonlinearity is th e fundamental challenge th at must be addressed for effective interpretation. Most simply, this means th at you cannot effectively interpret your model by presenting a list of the estimated parameters. Instead, we believe that the most effective way to interpret these models is by]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Reviews Stata commands for fitting models,testing hypotheses,and computing measures of model fit* Our book deals with what we think are the most fundamental and useful cross-sectional regression models for categorical and count outcomes: binary logit and probit, ordinal logit and probit, multinomial logit, Poisson regression, and negative binomial regression. We also explore several less common models, such as the stereotype logistic regression model and the zero-inflated and zero-truncated count models.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The chapter briefly illustrates the mechanics of using these commands in the context of a complex survey The example dataset used in this chapter is the nhanes2.dta dataset. This is one of the Stata example datasets and is used via the Internet with the webuse command, shown below. 1 2 webuse nhanes2 svyset The svyset command has already been used to declare the design for this survey, naming the primary]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[The chapter begins with a discussion of logistic regression models(most detailed) 1 Binary logistic regression 1.1 A logistic model with one categorical predictor Let’s consider a simple logistic regression model that predicts whether a person smokes (smoke) by the person’s self-reported social class (class). The variable class is a categorical variable that is coded: 1 = lower class, 2]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This chapter considers models where time is treated as a categorical variable The models presented in this chapter will use the mixed command to fit a model that is a hybrid of a traditional repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a mixed model. Like the repeated-measures ANOVA, there will be one fixed intercept (rather than having random intercepts that we commonly see when using the mixed command). By specifying the]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This chapter considers models that involve the interaction of two categorical predictors with a linear continuous predictor. 1 Chapter overview This chapter blends these two modeling techniques by exploring how the slope of the continuous variable varies as a function of the interaction of the two categorical variables. Let’s consider a hypothetical example of a model with income as the outcome variable. The predictors include gender]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[One of the unique features of multilevel models is the ability to study cross-level interactions—the interactions of a level-1 variable with a level-2 variable. Such interactions allow you to explore the extent to which the effect of a level-1 variable is moderated by a level-2 variable. 1 Chapter overview This chapter contains four examples, all]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This chapter considers models involving the analysis of longitudinal data. Such designs involve participants that are observed at more than one time point and time is generally treated as one of the important predictors in the model. Like any predictor, we need to ask ourselves how we want to model the relationship between time and the outcome. A key distinction is whether time will be treated as a continuous variable]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This chapter illustrates how to fit models in which a continuous variable, fit in a piecewise manner, is interacted with a categorical variable. 1 One knot and one jump For example, education was modeled in a piecewise manner including one knot at 12 years of education. This knot signifies both a change of slope and change in intercept (jump). The model also includes gender as a categorical variable and estimates]]></description>
